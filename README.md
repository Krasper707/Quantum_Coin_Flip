# Quantum Coin Flip Simulator

A Python-based quantum computing project that simulates a quantum coin flip using Qiskit. The project demonstrates the principles of superposition and measurement in quantum computing by simulating multiple coin flips and visualizing the results.

## Introduction

In classical computing, a coin flip is a binary event with two possible outcomes: heads or tails. In quantum computing, a coin flip can be simulated using a qubit in superposition. This project uses Qiskit, a popular quantum computing framework, to simulate quantum coin flips and visualize the results using histograms.

## Features

- Simulates a quantum coin flip using a single qubit.

- Visualizes the results of multiple coin flips using histograms.

- Built using Qiskit and Matplotlib.
